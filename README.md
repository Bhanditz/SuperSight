# Why SuperSight ?

A few months ago I set up a data pipeline within the AWS ecosystem. The final step was to refresh dashboards regularly on QuickSight. Coming from Matplotlib and its unlimited power it was quite frustrating not to be able to design the very plot I had in mind. Notebooks are great for low level work but perhaps not for showing off results to top managers. SuperSight is designed to fill the gap between notebooks and commercial business intelligence tools.
